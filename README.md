# Matplotlib Games

Some games entirely written in python using `matplotlib`.

## Why?

Of course `matplotlib` is a plotting library and was never intended to write games.
This repository is just to illustrate what `matplotlib` is capable of.

## How do I play?

All the subfolder of this repository contain a `__main__.py` file. You can just
play the game by running

```
$   python game
```
In the terminal.
